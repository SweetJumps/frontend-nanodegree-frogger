## Instructions

Simply load the index.html file into your favorite browser to play this game based on the classic Frogger arcade game.

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move your player on the screen (left, right, up and down).

Avoid the bugs and cross safely to the river to win. If you run into a bug, your turn will end and you will be sent back to the starting position to try again.

Have fun!
